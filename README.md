Hello,

I'm Swarnaditya & I live in small village Eastern India 🌇.

I am a software engineer & lead in cloud infrastructure, platforms & tools 🔧 heavily in to automation, operations, reliability & security. At any point in time my role will probably have something like Platform / Reliability / DevOps in the title. I'm also in to DX, FinOps 💰, technical product management, collaboration, improvement, leadership & many other things. Really, I have always been unavoidably interested in e2e systems & delivery & am compelled to improve value streams wherever the impact is most meaningful.

I try to continuously learn as I do believe knowledge is power 🔮 & details matter. Current areas of interest include service mesh, networking, multi-cloud (Azure) & custom development related to kubernetes and automation use cases.

I'm versatile & pragmatic, decomposing work & making architectural transitions with as little disruption as feasible.# 👋 Hi, I'm Swarnaditya

I live in a small village in Eastern India 🌇.

I am a software engineer and lead in cloud infrastructure, platforms, and tools 🔧, heavily into automation, operations, reliability, and security. I'm also into  FinOps 💰technical product management, collaboration, improvement, leadership, and many other things. Really, I have always been unavoidably interested in end-to-end systems and delivery and am compelled to improve value streams wherever the impact is most meaningful.

I try to continuously learn as I believe knowledge is power 🔮 and details matter. Current areas of interest include Kubernetes networking CNI , multi-cloud (Azure/AWS/GKE), and custom development related to Kubernetes and automation use cases.

I'm versatile and pragmatic, decomposing work and making architectural transitions with as little disruption as feasible.

I do like working in and around the Kubernetes ecosystem ☸️🌍. My current favorite tool is GitHub Copilot.

Outside of technology, I like my ped 🐕 Aduri, football ⚽ and lots of normal things 📺🍸.

I am an open-source enthusiast.

Thank you for reading and giving your time!

Cheers 🍻  
Swarnaditya
