👋 Hi, I'm Swarnaditya

I live in a small village in Eastern India 🌇

I am a Custom Software Enginner Lead Engineer in Accenture currently and lead in cloud infrastructure, platforms, and tools 🔧, heavily into automation, operations, reliability, and security. I'm also into  FinOps 💰technical product management, collaboration, improvement, leadership, and many other things. Really, I have always been unavoidably interested in end-to-end systems and delivery and am compelled to improve value streams wherever the impact is most meaningful.

I try to continuously learn as I believe knowledge is power 🔮 and details matter. Current areas of interest include Kubernetes networking CNI , multi-cloud (Azure/AWS/GKE), and custom development related to Kubernetes and automation use cases.

I do like working in and around the Kubernetes ecosystem ☸️🌍. My current favorite tool is GitHub Copilot.

Outside of technology, I like my ped 🐕 Aduri and my Roosters 🐔 (Naruto,Speed,Helly) football ⚽ and lots of abnormal things 📺🍸.

I am an open-source enthusiast.

Thank you for reading and giving your time!

Cheers 🍻  
Swarnaditya
